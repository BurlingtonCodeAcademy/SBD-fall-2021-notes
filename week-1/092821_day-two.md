# Variables

## Assigning Variables

A variable is a name for a value using an assignment operator

_Let_ declares the variable and accounts for all scopes while also being the most common, while _Var_ doesn't always respect scope

Always use _**Let**_ instead of _var_

Pick good names and don't use single letter variables, this is so you can read your code as well as others

_Let_ also allows you the change the variable, while _const_ wont allow for reassignment

**Variable names cannot have spaces or dashes and are case sensitive**
You can only use _let_ once per variable

camelCase is the industry standard for variable naming, however snake_case and kebob-case are also sometimes used

Variable names should be small and concise

## Variable Shadowing

Variable shadowing refers to the practice of naming two variables — for example, a global and a local variable or a local variable and a callback function parameter — with the same name and within scopes that overlap. The variable scoping rule states that inner scope can access variables defined in the outer scope.

## Pointer Metaphor

Think of variables as arrows pointing to values

## Changing Variables

**Reassignment** only changes the name of an object. It does _not_ change the data inside the object

Thnik of this like removing a label from one box and placing it on a different box.

## Pointers

You can create multiple variables that point to the same thing.

## Return Values

Most messages return new values, you can add methods to new variables while the original will remain the same

## Changing Values

Most messages don't change the data inside an object, This is true for all strings, since strings in JavaScript are immutable. Any message that transforms a string will return you an entirely new string, but some messages **do** change the contents!

## Const

_**Const**_ is like _Let_ but also _prevents reassignment_

the value of a _const_ is constant after it has been set

## Scope

All variables are defined within a certain scope

To keep track of scope pay attention to the levels of indentation (also use Bracket Pair Colorizer extension)

_if_ statements and _functions_ also have their own scope

You can always look **outside** of the _scope_ you are in but can not look **into** another _scope_

```
console.log("Hello World!")
let scope = "global"

{
    let scope = "block scope"
    {
        let scope = "more block"

        console.log(scope) //this would return "more block"
    }
    console.log(scope) //this would return "block scope"
}

console.log(scope) //this would return "global"
```

_Scope_ determines where we can use certain _variables_

Any variable defined at the **root level** of your file is in the **global scope**


# Functions

Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again. Functions can be "called" from the inside of other functions.

They are named just like variables, but make sure they are concise.

You can call a function by using it's name plus `()` -`function add(numOne, numTwo)` would be called by using `add()`

## Passing Variables to Functions

When you pass a variable to a function, that variable's value is assigned to a parameter.

## The Four Functional Syntaxes

1. Function Declaration syntax - the most common - `function variable(x) {Do stuff}`
2. Function Expression - `let variable = function(x){Do stuff}`
3. Arrow Function Expression - `let variable = (x) => {Do Stuff}`
4. Arrow Function Expression w/ Implicit Return Value - `let variable = (x) => Stuff`

Outside of the functional declaration, the other functions "name" is the variable it points to

# Null

## Null is Useful

Null is a **falsy** value that means there is no value
Null can be used as a place holder, or a 'nothing yet' scenario, and as a guard clause in your program

## Null Errors are good

Errors tell us:

- There is a mistake somewhere,
- What ths mistake is,
- and often how to fix it.

## TypeError explained

"TypeError" is an error about data types.
"Cannot read property" means there is no such property
"of null" is the value you were using
This error is confusing because the reason and location of the error is at the end of the message

## Null Pointer Errors

Very Common Error
The trick is reading the error to determine:

1. Where (which line)
2. Which variable is null
3. Why it was null

## Failing

2 Failure Philosophies:

1. Fail fast, Fail Hard


    - good for programmers
      -exposes errors early
      -forces critical thinking
      -provides helpful info about why it failed

2. Keep calm and carry on


    - good for users
      -context is easier to read
      -user can still use program

Both are useful

## Nulls are falsey

-`null` means nothing, -`undefined` means "I don't know" -`NaN` means Not a Number -`''` means an empty string

## Truthiness

- computers have either a *true* or *false* there is no grey area

## Comparisons

```
Operator	Comparison

<	          less than
>	          greater than
<=	         less than or equal to
>=	         greater than or equal to
==	         equal to
!=	         not equal
===	        really equal to
!==	        really not equal to

```

We can use these operators to create a true or false statement that can be used to conditionally render code.

## Conditions

- in JS we write conditionals with `if` statements
    - `if(/*argument*/) {/*run this code*/}`

## What is falsiness?

- `false`, `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, and an empty string (`""`) are all falsy
- `true` is truthy `false` is falsy

- Be careful though the string `"false"` and the string `"0"` are truthy
    - this is because a string containing any character is truthy even if that character is falsy

## The Tragedy of the Equal Sign
- A single equals sign means **assignment**
    - name = "Alice" -- means "the value of name is "Alice"
- Two or 3 Equal signs means **comparison**
    - name == "Alice" - this is checking to see if the calue of name is "Alice"

## if.. then.. else..

- `else` allows **branching**

```
if(age >= 18){
    console.log("allowed")
} else{
    console.log("denied")
}
```
- this allows the program to choose one path or the other
    - **if** the first path is not true, it will send the program down the `else` path

## Conjunction Junction

You can combine comparisons with logical Operators

- AND - &&
- OR - ||
- NOT - !

for example:
```
if (age >= 18 || hasPermissionSlip()) {
    console.log("allowed")
}
```
