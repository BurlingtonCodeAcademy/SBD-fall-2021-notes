## Arrays

- Arrays are containers that contain other objects

## What makes an array an array

- You can put values in them
- They stay in order (unless changed by you)
- accepts duplicates

## Creating an array

`["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`

- square brackets define "this is an array"
- items in the array are separated by commas

## Array Indexes

- each item has an index
    - you can find items by their index number
    - indexes are 0 based
- square brackets after an array mean "the item in this index number"

example:
```
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits[1]
```

## Start at zero

- arrays are 0 indexed

## Length

using the `.length` property will return the number of objects in the array
- not in a 0 based index

to find the last item of the array you can do `array[array.length -1]`

## After the end

if you try to find an item in the array after the end of the array, you get **undefined**

this means that there is nothing in that spot.

## Array Methods

[MDN: Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Methods_2) contains a ton of different properties that work with array values

## Adding Values to an Array

`.push` adds a single value to the end of an array
- you can push multiple items at once by putting a comma between your values

## Yarra Lasrever

you can use `array.reverse()` to return your array in reverse order

## Slicing and Dicing

you can `slice` an array to cut it into smaller arrays

example:
```
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']

fruits.slice(1,3) // this means to slice from item 1 to item 3

fruits.slice(2) // this means to slice from item 2 until the end
```
## Array to String

ways to turn an array into a string
- `.join()`
- `.join("and")`
- `.toString()`
- `.toSource()`

>The `.toSource()` method only works in web browsers and not in NodeJS

## String to Array

Turning a string into an array
`dog.split('') // =>['d', 'o', 'g']`

## Loops and Iterators

"iterating" means to go through the array, one at a time, then do something with each of these items

## Explicit: Looping through an Array with for

`for(;;)` came from C
- it's cumbersome but you should know it

example:
```
for(let i=0; i< fruits.length; i++) {
    console.log(fruits[i])
}
```

## Looping Through an Array with for-of

`for..of` is new in JavaScript and hides the mess from `for('')` loops

example:

```
for(let fruit of fruits){
    console.log("I like " + fruit + "!")
}
```

## Looping Through an Array with forEach

`forEach` acts like `for..of` but as a *function*

example:
```
fruits.forEach((fruit)=>{
    console.log("I like " + fruit + "!")
})
```
## Setting Items in an Array

`[]` words for assignment as well

`fruits[0] = 'apricot'` will set the item in the `[0]` index to the string 'apricot'

## Checking Every Item in an Array

`.includes()` checks to see if the given value is inside the array

## Stack

- a stack is a metaphor for a physical stack
    - Last in, First out

## What makes a stack a stack?

- a stack has two operators
    - `push` adds an item to the top
    - `pop` removes an item from the top

- you take things off the top of the stack in **reverse** order

## Freedom of Constraints

it's powerful because of the limitations
    - easier to optimize
    - easier to debug
    - easier to understand code that uses it

## Arrays vs Stacks

- easiest way to implement a stack is by using an *array*
    - arrays already have a `push` and `pop` methods

## Stack Trace

Stack traces are what you are given when you are given errors. 
- JavaScript interpreter is a program that uses the stack to internally keep track of the list of functions

## Uses for Stacks

- reading the stack trace
- function call stacks
- backtracking in games
- recursion
- web page navigation's

# Iteration Methods

## What makes an object an Object?

- Methods
- Properties

## Arrays are Objects

JS *arrays* are objects
- arrays have *properties* and *methods*

example
- `array.length` is a read only property
- `array.reverse()`

## Iteration Methods

- forEach
- find
- filter
- map

## forEach

`forEach` works like `for..of` but uses a callback function

## Find

`find` method returns an item from an array

## Filter

`filter` returns *all* matching values in a *new array*

- `find` returns the first match

## Map

`map` returns a *new array* whose elements correspond to the elements of the original array

```
let names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Carol', 'David'];
let upper = function(word) {
    return word.toUpperCase();
}
let bigNames = names.map(upper) //=> [ 'ALICE', 'BOB', 'CHARLIE', 'CAROL', 'DAVID' ]
```

## Aside: Method Chaining

- Method chaining takes the **result** from one method, and immediately calls another method on it **without assigning it to a variable**
- it can be very elegant but also very dense
- "unspooling" a method chain can make it easier to follow

## Reduce

`reduce` keeps track of a *running total*
