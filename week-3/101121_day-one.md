# How The Web Works 

## Browsers - what do they do?

- browsers request information in the form of a file associated with a specific URL
- then renders the code in the form of a website

## Request - Response

- HTTP = *Hypertext Transfer Protocol*
- they are requests sent by the browser to find the location of a file
- files contain code and your browser renders it

## HTTP Methods

- `GET`
    - browsers send a `GET` request to a web server

- `POST`
    - when a form is submitted, a `POST` request is submitted, it sends it to the server

## DNS

- Domain Name Service
- How browsers know **where** the website lives
- The browser talks with a **nameserver** which tells the browser where to fid the files for your site
- information on your name servers are known as **DNS Records**

## HTTP: File Transfer for the Web

- HTTP
    - invented around 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee
    - uses TCP/IP

- HTTP is a *file transfer protocol*
    - HTTP responses contain a *body* which is the raw contents of a file
    - these files can be images, sounds, data, or code

## Examples of Web Code

Common examples of web code:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Those are languages that run **inside** the browser ("client side")

Server side examples:

- PHP
- Ruby
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript

## HTTP 0.9 Goals (1991)

- **very** simple protocol
- 100% ASCII characters
- human readability
- **stateless*

## HTTP 1.0 (93-96)

- developed *ad hoc* because of WWW exploding
    - odd decisions were made but we're now stuck with them
- upgrades from 0.9
    - version identifier
    - request headers
    - response status line
    - response headers


## HTTP 1.0 Details

- *port* is a TCP/IP concept
    - default port for HTTP is 80
    - default port for HTTPS is 443
- request and some response are all ASCII
- `Content-Type` header allows different file types
    - reused **MIME** (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
- `Content-Length` header so the client knows how large of a file to expect

# Intro to HTML

## Intro to HTML

- Hyper-Text Markup Language
- One HTML file is one HTML page
- Based in SGML
- Standard language used for creating web pages
- Composed of tags
- CSS and JavaScript are designed to work with HTML
- HTML is for structuring content
    - it does not perform complex computations

## What is it?

- HTML is a language composed of *tags* or *elements*

## Elements(aka Tags)

- Elements
    - consist of the Tags and Everything inside of it

- Tags
    - must have an opening and closing tag
    - they wrap the content of the elements

## Structural Tags (Layout)

These tags are to help structure your page

## Style Tags

These tags can be used to change the design of your page

## Self Closing Tags

- Not all tags need a matching closing tags. 
- Some close on their own.

`<img src="myImg.jpg" />` => self closing  
`<img src="myImg.jpg"></img>` => same code with a closing tag

## Attributes

Attributes further define HTML elements

Example:

`<img src="/images/cat-pic.jpg" title="Cat Picture alt="Picture of a fuzzy cat">`

- `src` is where the file lives
- `alt` is the text that is displayed if the image breaks
    - also used for screen readers
- Attributes are not always required
- Other Attributes:
    - `style` (for CSS)
    - `title` (hover tool tips)
    - `href` (hyperlink reference)

## Style vs Layout vs Semantics

Some tags are to describe *how* it's content should be displayed vs some tags *describe* it's contents. 

- not all HTML elements convey meaning
- imagine a blind person using a screen reader, how might they understand the difference between
    - `<strong>`
    - `<b>`

## HTML Has Flaws

- Hard to parse
- Poor Whitespace rules
- Case insensitive except when it's not
- Open anc close tag names should match but aren't required to
- browsers will happily render bad HTML
- Muddled distinctions
    - between *semantics* and *style*
    - between *elements* and *attributes* and *content*

# Styling with CSS

## CSS
- Cascading Style Sheet
- Responsible for how your HTML **looks**

## Why Does CSS Exist?
- CSS formats your page
- it can be written within HTML or using an external style sheet
    - using an external style sheet prevents you from having to write code multiple times

## Styling Text with CSS
- CSS properties modify the appearance of HTML
    - this is done by targeting HTML **elements**

## Inline Style
- using a `style` attribute of an element you can style inside of your html

Example: `<h1 style="color: red; font-size: 32px;">


## Including CSS in HTML

Theres a few ways to include CSS in HTML
- `<h1 style="color: red; font-size: 32px;">` Inline
- `<link>` Tag to a CSS file
- `<style>` Tags with @import of a CSS file

## Selectors and Properties
- Selectors determine where styles are applied
- Properties determine what those styles are
- CSS starts with a selector (id or class) followed by curly brackets
- declare your styles inside the curly brackets

## Compound Selectors 1
- Selectors can target elements that are nested  
- Example: `p img {...}`
    - this targets an image inside of a paragraph

## Compound Selectors 2
- selectors can target specific elements in a class
- Example: `h1 .title{...}`

## Compound Selectors 3

- Selectors can target elements multiple layers deep
- Example: `main .introduction > p {...}`

## Psudo-Class Selectors

- Hover
- Visited
- Checked
- Active
- Others

# CSS Layout

## Block Level vs Inline

-Block - New Line, full width, can contain both block and inline elements.
-Inline - Same line, width of content, should only contain data, or other inline elements.

`display` Property determines an element's layout and how it interacts with other elements
-`display: block;` - element will take up full width of page
-`display: inline;` - width of content
-`display: inline-block;` - Acts like inline, but can manipulated 
-`display: none;` - element will disappear, as will all its children, and its neighbors will be rendered as if it was never there

Block Level Elements:
`<div>`
`<p>`
`<table>`
`<form>`
`<ul>, <ol>`
`<nav>`

Inline Elements:
`<span>`
`<a>`
`<i>, <em>`
`<b>, <strong>`
`<img>`
`<button>`

## Positioning
1. Relative - Elements are relative to the flow of the HTML document, means "my children are positioned relative to me"
Elements moved around with the properties top, left, right, bottom. 
2. Absolute - This is positioned relative to its parent or ancestor (closest ancestor that is relatively positioned, means "I am positioned relative to my parent"
3. Fixed - Position an element is relation to its viewport (browser window).
4. Static- Same as relative, but cannot be moved with top/left/right/bottom. It is relative to the flow of the HTML document.

In order to make content layout work in CSS, you often need to introduce wrapper `<div>`

Floats are weird and frustrating, but are generally used for text wrapping. Recent developments have allowed developers to use new CSS properties to achieve the same results as float, and much more, so because of this, the float property should only be used for wrapping text around images, which was its original purpose - gone are the days of CSS layout using floats.
