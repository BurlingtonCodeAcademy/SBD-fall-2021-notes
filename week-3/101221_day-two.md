# CSS Layout

## Block Level vs Inline

-Block - New Line, full width, can contain both block and inline elements.
-Inline - Same line, width of content, should only contain data, or other inline elements.

`display` Property determines an element's layout and how it interacts with other elements
-`display: block;` - element will take up full width of page
-`display: inline;` - width of content
-`display: inline-block;` - Acts like inline, but can manipulated 
-`display: none;` - element will disappear, as will all its children, and its neighbors will be rendered as if it was never there

Block Level Elements:
`<div>`
`<p>`
`<table>`
`<form>`
`<ul>, <ol>`
`<nav>`

Inline Elements:
`<span>`
`<a>`
`<i>, <em>`
`<b>, <strong>`
`<img>`
`<button>`

## Positioning
1. Relative - Elements are relative to the flow of the HTML document, means "my children are positioned relative to me"
Elements moved around with the properties top, left, right, bottom. 
2. Absolute - This is positioned relative to its parent or ancestor (closest ancestor that is relatively positioned, means "I am positioned relative to my parent"
3. Fixed - Position an element is relation to its viewport (browser window).
4. Static- Same as relative, but cannot be moved with top/left/right/bottom. It is relative to the flow of the HTML document.

In order to make content layout work in CSS, you often need to introduce wrapper `<div>`

Floats are weird and frustrating, but are generally used for text wrapping. Recent developments have allowed developers to use new CSS properties to achieve the same results as float, and much more, so because of this, the float property should only be used for wrapping text around images, which was its original purpose - gone are the days of CSS layout using floats.

## Float

Floats, to say the least, are weird and can be frustrating.
It used to be that floats were the only way to achieve specific layouts using CSS, especially:
stacking left-to-right or right-to-left forcing an element to be as wide as its contents, not as wide as its parent

example of an image wrapper: 
`<style>
  .image-wrapper {
    position: relative;
    float: left;
  }
</style>`

*TIP: applying clear: both to an element will make it skip down the page past all floats, left and right. This is usually done to a <br>*

#### Floats (Advice)

- For a long time, floats were the backbone of page layout using CSS.
- However, recent developments have allowed developers to use new CSS properties to achieve the same result, and much more.
- Because of this, the float property should only be used for wrapping text around images, which was its original purpose - gone are the days of CSS layout using floats.
