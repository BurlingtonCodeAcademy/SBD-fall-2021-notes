# Responding to Events

- Handling events is similar to handling DOM events
    - functions are passed as Props
    - camelCase events. 
        - `onClick`
        - `onSubmit`
        - `onHover`
    - we are no longer using `addEventListener` because that is direct DOM manipulation

## Preventing Default Behavior

- Calling `event.preventDefault()` is required in the handler

## React Events are SyntheticEvents

- They are not **real** DOM events
- They are captured byt react and replaced with SyntheticEvent
    - They behave the same across all Browsers
        - unlike DOM events
    
## Events are Nullified after Handling

- After event handler funciton is called, the event is set to null
    - SyntheticEvents are used for other Events
- Do not handle events using Async functions, unless calling `event.persist()` first

## Binding Event Handlers

- JS classes do not `bind` the `this` by default
- Binding is a normal and very confusing behavior in JS
- Either use `bind` in the constructor or use a fat arrow function

## Binding Event Handlers - Arrow Functions

- `this.function = this.function.bind(this)` is verbose
- Writing the class property as `handleClick = () => {do_stuff_here}` is a less verbose way to bind your function to the class

# React Hooks

## How to Use Hooks

- Hooks are to be used from *inside* any React Functional components
- Hooks can be reused multiple times

- How to **not** use hooks:
    - in the global name space
    - in class based components
    - in Loops
    - in conditional Statements
    - in nested functions

## How Hooks Work

- Hooks are functions that come with React
    - you import them by targeting them directly
    - `import React, {useState} from 'react'`

- Each hook can be used multiple times but order is important
- Must be rendered in the same order every time to work properly

## Benefits of Hooks

- Simplicity of functional components with the power of class components
- Related operations can be bundled together
- stateful logic can be reused between components

>NOTE: It is just the logic that can be reused, not the values in state

## Types of Hooks

- Basic Hooks:
    - `useState`
    - `useEffect`
    - `useContext`
- Less Common:
    - `useReducer`
    - `useCallback`
    - `useMemo`
    - `useRef`
    - `useImpreativeHandle`
    - `useLayoutEffect`
    - `useDebugValue`

## useState

- how to use `useState`
    - `import{useState} from 'react'`
    - `const [property, setProperty] = useState(initialValue)`
    - `evt => {setProperty(evt.target.value)}`

## useEffect

- `useEffect` is to set up "side effects"
- all-in-one function for
    - `componentDidMount`
    - `componentDidUpdate`
    - `componentWillUnmount`

## useEffect with no Cleanup

- effects that don't require cleanup can be ran on every render
    - example:
        - `useEffect(() => {document.title = fullName + "'s page"})`
    
## Cleaning up After useEffect

- if information is coming from an outside source, clean up is required. 
    - prevents memory leaks
    - requires a `return` from your `useEffect` callback function

## Creating Custom Hooks

You can create custom hooks by writing functions that perform the action you want the hook to take

## Hook Naming Conventions

- start your custom Hook with `use` so React can recognize it as a valued Hook

# Props and State (continued)

## State - Updates can be Async

- `setState()` causes an update
- we can combine like updates for better performance
- we can pass a callback function to update state

## State - Updates are Merged

- When state has a lot of properties we can update each separately which allows for independent merges
    - these merges are shallow


## Using Functional Component Syntax

- We can create a functional component and import it into our Stateful component when we need it.
- We can also slot it into another stateless component and pass props directly to it
