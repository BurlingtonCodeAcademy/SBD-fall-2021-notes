# Intro to Server-Side JS

## What is a server?

- The term *server* refers to both software/hardware. 
- It defines the relationship between the computer a user is interacting with, (the client) and a different environment that tehy will request information from

### Hardware Servers

- Ordinary Computer
    - usually elsewhere
    - can be the same computer
    
- Defines behavior
- Contains components for websites

### Software Servers

- understands URLs
- listens for *protocol* request
- responds to requests
- sends responses

## Requests

- Requests are sent from the *client*
- sent to server via protocol
- intentional and explicit
- can contain user input
- used for:
    - updating database
    - navigation
    - retrieve information

## Responses

- Sent by server
- sends information to the client
- determined by the request recieved
- can carry out actions
- contains status codes
    - 200 is `okay`
    - 404 is `not found`

## Headers

Headers contain additional information sent to and from the server

- **request headers**
    - contains information about client
- **response header**
    - contains details about the response
- **general headers**
    - can be included in request and responses but provide no info based on what is contained

## Server-side programming

- used to deliver information efficiently
- used to keep things secure
- versatile
- not visible to client
- many programming languages

# Serving Files

## Serving Files

HTTP is a *file transfer protocol*

- *path* element of a URL is based on a Unix file path
- most servers map incoming URL paths to filesystem paths
- they are called *static files* because they are stored on the disk of the server
    - *dynamic pages* create on the fly for every request

## node-static

- Early in the course we used `node-static` or `liveserver` to serve our HTML, JS, CSS, images, ect

## Static File Servers in Express

- Express comes with its own static file server

`app.use(express.static('.'))`

## Oops!

- Good news:
    - Your web server can now serve static files!
- Bad news:
    - clients can now see *any files they like* in your project

## Solution: Public Directory

- most web apps have a *public* directory
    - this segregates *client-side files* from *server-side files*

- create a `public` folder inside of your project and change your app.use to

`app.use(express.static('public'))`

- Now you can seperate your HTML, CSS, and images into your `/public` where clients can fetch as needed

- move `index.html` from top level to `public`

- restart server

- open web browser to `http://localhost:5000/index.html`

## Content-Type

- files have different *extensions* that tell you what file type they are
    - `.html` or `.htm` means HTML
    - `.js` means JavaScript
    - `.css` means CSS Stylesheet

- URLs do not have extensions

- web servers read the file type extensions in the HTTP header to tell the client what it is

    - `text/html` means HTML
    - `application/javascript` means JavaScript
    - `text/css` means CSS stylesheet

## 404 Not Found and other status codes

- when the web browser has an error loading the file, the server must send the correct status code
    - 404 means not found

>Note: even though there is an error, the server still returns a body and content type for display to the user

# Forms

## Forms contain inputs

- `<form>` elements contain inputs
    - user inputs data
    - clicks submit
    - browser sends it to the server

## Forms are semantic

- form wraps *input* elements
    - can include or be included in other elements
- `<form>` element will correspond to a block element(border of the form)
    - `<form>` elements are inline
    - wrap it in a `<div>` to make it block
    - apply styles to the `<div>` and leave the `<form>` alone

## Form attributes

- `method` - first word in the HTTP protocol
    - `GET` is the standard
    - `POST`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, `DELETE` are other methods
- `action` - server path
    - if blank, uses the path of the current page

## Form Methods: GET vs POST

- `GET` means "return me a page"
- `POST` means "take these params, then return me a page"

`GET` is for reading  
`POST` is for writing

`GET` also sends all parameters via the request URL
`POST` sends some or all parameters via the request body

## Form Elements

- `<label>` marks some text that belongs to an input
- `<input name="q" type="search">` is a text field
    - removes line breaks and may look different
- `<input type="submit" value="search">`
    - button who'se label is the string "search"

## Intercepting forms with JS

- JS can add a submit event handler
    - "onsubmit"
- function will be called after the user clicks "submit"
- allows you to modify data sent to the server
- for the form to only be used by JS you must do:
    - `<form href="#">` in HTML
        - OR
    - `event.preventDefault()`

## Form submission: how does it work?

- user enters values into inputs
- user either
    - clicks submit
    - presses enter
    - js calls `form.submit()` on the DOM element
- client sends HTTP request
    - includes params like `q=apple&submit=Search`

## Forms as Input

- simplest way to handle user input is as a form with an `<input type="text"/>` and an `<input type="submit" />`
- Then use the user inputs in your JS to manipulate the values as necessary
