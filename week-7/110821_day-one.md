# Databases

## Database Definition

- a structured set of data held in a computer, usually organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated

## Server vs Server vs Server

- types of servers
    - A Database Process running on a computer that responds to queries
    - the actual computer running that process
    - the application code that is a server but is a client of that database server

## Application Database vs Integration Database

- application db
    - had only one kind of client, a single application written and maintained by a single team of software engineers
- integration db
    - many kind of client applications, may even support direct hand-crafted console queries by humans

## Application DB vs Integration DB
- an application db is easier to change since all its use is encapsulated by a single application

## Relational DB vs Document DB

- relational db
    - stores information in tables
    - every record in the table has the same flat structure
    - structure is defined beforehand

- document db
    - stores information in documents
    - records can contain any fields
    - can include collections and child records directly
    - don't require an explicit schema

## DB Concepts
- connection
- collection
- record
- primary key
- CRUD
- index
- query / search
- transaction
- blob
- join

## Connection

- db protocols are stateful
    - communication between client and server involve more than a single request and response
- client connects to server early on and authenticates itself(logs in)
    - keeps connection open
- can lead to trouble
    - servers have a limit on number of connections they preserve
- stateful connections enable other features
    - transactions
    - caching
    - loading balancing

## Collections

- data is stored in collections
    - require unique names
    - in SQL dbs, a collection is a table

Example (SQL):

`SELECT * FROM students` -- give all the fields from all the records from the table named 'students'

Example (Mongo):

`db.collection('students').find({}) -- give all the documents from the collection named 'students'

## Record

- Data is stored in packets called records
- every record in a collection has the same field names but each record usually has different values in each field
- in SQL DBs, a record is also a row
- in NoSQL DBs, a record is usually called a document

## Primary Key

- a field that uniquely identifies a record from other records
- primary key is usually an integer
    - sometimes a string
    - also called an id
- dbs usually cause new records to automatically get either:
    - the next integer in a sequence or,
    - a UUID which is a very large randomized number

## CRUD
- 4 basic operations for DBs
    - Create
    - Read
    - Update
    - Delete

## JIST
- other fairly standard DB features
    - Join
    - Index
    - Search
    - maintain Transactional integrity

## Query / Search

- Query
    - request to the DB
- Search
    - find operations that may return multiple files
    - a full text search or keyword search that looks for text inside certain fields

## Cursor

- queries can return many results, sometimes more then what can fit in memory
    - most DBs provide an object called a Cursor which fetches some of the results but not always all of them at once
    - you can then ask a cursor for the next result and it will automatically go back to the db and get the next page

## Transaction
- DBs are good at handling different queries simultaneously
- transactions wrap up several operations so they happen together
- for example
    - making a transfer between two bank accounts, the withdrawal and deposit happen in one transaction
- if any step in a transaction fails
    - the transaction rolls back
    - all changes are reverted
    - no other changes happen
- if successful
    - the transaction is committed and other connections see the changes
- known as an atomic operation
    - several actions behaving as one

## Blob
- stands for Binary Large Object
    - also is a good metaphor

- it's any piece of data that the DB treats like a blob
    - it does not look inside,
    - doesn't know it's value,
    - can't sort based on it,
    - allows it to be an arbitrarily small or large

- Example:
    - profile picture image file

- storing BLOBs is often convenient
    - useful for prototyping or for apps with low-to-middling preformance

- for high-performance web apps
    - better idea to store meda files in a CDN
        - in your db, store a URL or ID pointing to the file in the CDN
    
## Join

- if a `Person` has an `Address`, those are stored in separate tables
    - to get the person *and* their address in a *single query* you need to **join** the tables together

- syntax can be complicated, but at heart it's straightforward:
    - give A and B, return A+B together

## Schema

- defines types, names, valid values of a DB
- in SQL the schema is explicit and must be define before inserting any data
- in NoSQL, the schema is implicit and up the the developer to ensure the data conforms to the application's needs.
    - you can use frameworks such as mongoose for schema validation.

# Mongodb

[Mongodb Site](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Setup

- Download [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

- This should include MongoDB Compass
    - Compass is a GUI that provides a platform to view your data without the initial need for knowing MongoDB query syntax


## MongoDB Overview

- Document db (NoSQL)
- horizontal sharing => can serve trillions of records
- uses JS for data definition and manipulation
- built-in map-reduce for dynamic collections
- indexing on fields by value


## Concept: Collection

- A Collection holds documents
    - many collections can live in a DB
    - collections are the same as a *table* in SQL

## Concept: Document

- Documents are a single JS object
- similar to relational DBs, 
    - documents can be created, read, updated, deleted, indexed, and searched for
- unlike Relational DBs, documents can contain *any value* for it's field
    - including arrays and nested objects

- nesting and being flexible make it very appropriate to store whatever JS objects the app uses without mapping between nested objects and joined relational tables

## Drivers

- MongoDB uses it's own [query syntax](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/)
    - similar to JS at times
    - has it's own rules and structure

- allows MongoDB to be used with many languages through the use of drivers
    - we will be using MongoDB's Node.js driver

## Concept: ObjectId

- `_id` is assigned by Mongo when a document is created
- `ObjectId` is a factory function that either generates an Id, or transforms a given string into a Mongo ID object
