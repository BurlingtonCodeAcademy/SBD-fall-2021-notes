# Mongodb Queries

The following notes are assuming that our test-data includes:

```
   { item: "journal", qty: 25, size: { h: 14, w: 21, uom: "cm" }, status: "A" },
   { item: "notebook", qty: 50, size: { h: 8.5, w: 11, uom: "in" }, status: "A" },
   { item: "paper", qty: 100, size: { h: 8.5, w: 11, uom: "in" }, status: "D" },
   { item: "planner", qty: 75, size: { h: 22.85, w: 30, uom: "cm" }, status: "D" },
   { item: "postcard", qty: 45, size: { h: 10, w: 15.25, uom: "cm" }, status: "A" }
```

## Finding ALL documents in a Collection
- has no conditions
- bring back all fields in the document

```
const results = await collection.find({})
await results.forEach(doc => console.log(doc))
```

## Finding a Single Match

- `db.some-collection.findOne()` finds the first document that contains the argument passed to the method

```
const results = await collection.findOne({item:"planner"})
console.log(results)
```

- This will return the document, Not a cursor so we can use the results right away

## Finding SOME documents in a collection

- `.find()` can be passed arguments to find multiple things

```
const results = await collection.find( { status: "D" } )
await results.forEach(doc => console.log(doc))
```
- or

```
const results = collection.find( { status: "D", item: "planner" } )
await results.forEach(doc => console.log(doc))
```
- when we pass multiple arguments, a comma means &&

## Finding SOME documents using OR

```
const results = await collection.find(
  { $or: [
          { item: "Planner" },
          { item: "Notebook" }
         ]
  }
)
await results.forEach(doc => console.log(doc))
```

- the `$or:` takes an array, and the array consists of all of the key value pairs that we are looking for

- these properties do not need to be the same

## Finding SOME documents using RANGES

- we can use `$gt:` and `$lt:` to define greater than or less than
  - there is also `$gte:` and `$lte:` for greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to

- we can also use multiple conditions with ranges

```
const results = await collection.find( { status: "A", qty: { $lt: 30 } } )
await results.forEach(doc => console.log(doc))
```

- this will search for the `status of "A"` AND `less than 30`

## Querying for properties IN a set

- `$in:` looks within a set for specific properties
  - there is also `$nin` that is NOT in

```
const results = await collection.find( { status: { $in: ["A", "B", "C"] } } )
```
- This looks for things that are IN "A", "B", and "C"

## Querying Nested Documents

- We can target things by using exacted nested fields 

```
const results = await collection.find({ status: "A", size: { h: 14, w: 21, uom: "cm" } })
await results.forEach(doc => console.log(doc))
```

- or we can be more relaxed with our searches
```
const results = await collection.find({ "size.h": 14 });
await results.forEach(doc => console.log(doc))
```

- OR we can combine the tw0

```
const results = await collection.find({ status: "A", "size.h": 14 })
await results.forEach(doc => console.log(doc))
```

## Range Queries in Nested Documents

- we can search for single ranges or multiple ranges
```
const results = await collection.find({ "size.h":  { $gt: 10, $lt: 100 } })
await results.forEach(doc => console.log(doc))
```

## Range Queries in Nested Documents using OR

```
const results = await collection.find( {
     status: "A",
     $or: [
            { qty: { $lt: 30 } },
            { "size.h": { $gt: 10 } }
          ]
    }
)
await results.forEach(doc => console.log(doc))
```
